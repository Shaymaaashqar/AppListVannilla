I creat it via html,css and javascript,
1- Add button : add task to the list
2- done icon: to mark the task as done
3- empty icon : to mark the task as not done
4- remove icon : to remove the task from a list
5- ToDo label: to count all the task
6- Done label: to count the task which done 

there is an error in the ToDo and Done feild when i do refresh i tried to fix an error or conflict but i cant do it
